The Olympic District is perhaps one of the favorites of the Enyeta. It provides the Enyeta with their necessary...sacrifices. The Olympic District is loyal to the Enyeta, sometimes to a fault. But regardless this is your home. This District is all you know since the day you were born. Better than living in the Lawless District.

Your Coach is lecturing you, he keeps telling you that as star athlete at ${age} in school's ${varsity} team you set an example for this baseball season. The old you could be great speech. You hear it enough from your father.

You would hear it from your mother but she died in a tragic car accident which gave your father free rein to train you non-stop for sports. It was hard on you and your younger sister but your dad kept you so preoccupied that you and your sister Cassie didn't have time to grieve.

    ready for this season, Coach," you say with a sly smile. 
    Your Coach rolls his eyes. " All we need to work on is your cockiness, Carter. Have a good day, son. See you

You walk out Coach's office, down the hall. Slinging your backpack over your shoulder. The Sports Department is a big part of JamesBurg High School. It has to be since the Enyeta campaign for humans to be strong. There is no room for weakness. 
As you are walking you get stopped when you hear your buddy Mike calling your name down the hall. You turn around and see Mike jogging toward you.
Mike is your best friend, he is on the ${varsity} team too. He is second best after you. Mike is a big and burly guy with good looks. He has short brown hair and brown eyes. Tan skin and a tattoo of an ox on his arm. He slaps you on your arm.
*page_break
"How was the talk with Coach?" Mike asked. 
"Uhh uneventful. He just wants me ready for this season. Afraid he won't get the next piece of fake gold mounted on the wall," you tell Mike. 
Mike laughs at your joke. "Cool. Does that mean you down to see the fights at Chuck's?"
*page_break
Chuck's is a sports bar, one of the many in the Olympic District. Chuck's is where you and your teammates hangout most of the time. Mike and the guys usually go at around 8:00, you just hope your dad doesn't have any plans for you.

What do you tell Mike?

    Mike looks a little hurt by your answer. " What!? Come on man, why not?" Mike asks. "Depends on what I'm doing

    "Thats my main man. Is eight cool?" Mike asked.

*temp vehicle "Solar surfer"

  #Solar surfer.
    The new age surfboard. It has a rocket and sail attached to it with it you can ride in sky.
    Though use of this is restricted in some areas. The newest technology around.
    Your solar surfer is solar-powered, at night lunar-powered. When there is no moon, back up battery.
    Your solar surfer is a long metal surfboard with feet straps in the middle, to keep one from falling.
    On the back of it is a rocket, serves as the ignition. Once started up, a large sail comes out of the board.
    You use the bar on the sail to soar through the skies. Faster than any hovercar or hoverbike.

  #Hoverbike
    It's like a motorcycle only it hovers over the ground. No wheels.
    The funniest way to whip above the streets. Your hoverbike keeps your heart racing when you fly through the streets.
    *set vehicle "Hoverbike"
    *goto goodByeMike
  #Hovercar.
    It is a car with no wheels that hovers in the air. It is a fast way of transportation.
    One of the fastest ways of transportation. Took forever to learn how to drive once you got it but you're a pro now.

  #Harley Davidson bike.
    I like to keep myself grounded. You always did like your hair to breeze through the wind as you ride the streets on
    your bad ass Harley. Nothing better than a bike.

  #Sportscar
    You ride in a sweet "old school" red convertible car. Its called old school because most people drive in fancy
    hovercars or hoverbikes or ride on surfers. Nothing beats a classic.
