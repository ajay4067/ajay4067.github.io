*line_break
You park your ${vehicle} in the parking lot of Chuck's. Chuck's is one of the many sports bar in the Olympic District. Its one of the popular ones. Bars in the Olympic District are different from the ones in other Districts. 
The alcohol they serve works on Olympians, but once you are drunk for three hours the Olympian pisses it out. Since alcohol is unhealthy for the body. Thanks to a chemical from the G'lan. 
Chuck's is a huge bar with two floors, two bars on each floor. The high def tvs are a monstrous size. It is crowded in Chuck's but you are easily able to find Mike and the team. Mike looks happy to see you there, he pulls you to their table. The guys from the team greet you as if you're a celebrity. Being the star player will do that to you. Mike and the team got a good spot infront of the tv. The fights are about to start. 

"Glad you could make it man," Mike said, patting you on the back,

You and Mike watch as the L'oik gladiator fights start. The teenage boys in the bar start to whistle, even Mike gets a little excited. You look at the tv and see Alison Ryan, the best L'oik female gladiator. 
Alison Ryan is a gorgeous brunette with tan alabaster skin. She has long curly dark chocolate brown hair. She is sixteen years old. You say to yourself that she is maybe the sexiest girl you have ever seen. She is dressed in a leather dress that stops at her thighs. It is tight around her slim body. You see that her eyes are hazel-brown. Her eyes mesmerize you. Her tattoos are not visible, you wonder where they are. You swear you have seen her before, you just can't remember where. 
It makes you a little jealous listenin to everyone whistling as she prepares to fight a Verl'ak prisoner. The Verl'ak Verl'aks are human-like aliens. But if one looks closely, they don't look like humans. They have gills on their face and neck. Their eyes are all black, no pupils. They have ragged teeth like a great white shark's teeth. Pale skin that sends a chill up your spine even through a tv screen. Mike pats you on the back. 

" Yeah Verl'aks are ugly sons of bitches," Mike says.

    Yeah man but at least we do have to worry about that til two months from now," Mike says comfortingly. He pats you on the back and turns back to watching the sexy Alison Ryan, irritating you to no end. You try to shake off those feelings and enjoy the match because Alison does give a good show.

Gotta keep hanging out more often," Mike says. Mike pats you on the back, still snickering and turns back to watching the sexy Alison Ryan, irritating you to no end.

Alison and the large Verl'ak wait for the signal to start from the Leader of the Enyeta. You make sure to pay attention, because he rules everything. you see a human but not one you have ever seen. He is a completely different human. 
He has light colored skin. His eyes are an odd bright blue. They maybe cybernetics implants. He is handsome and holds himself with grace and authority. He has short silvery-grey hair, combed and styled with gel in a pompadour.
His face is clean shaven and hanging from his mouth is a cigar. He looks at you amused. Behind him is are two guard of G'lan. Though they stand to the back of the balcony. Behind him is as seventeen year old boy with platinum blonde hair. It is cut short showing his strong and handsome facial features. He is muscular and lean wearing roman-like armor. He has a sword on his left side, he is right handed then. He has a flowing red cape behind his armor, holding himself as regally as the Leader of the Enyeta. They look alike in the
face, it maybe his son. 
The Leader of the Enyeta stands up and lifts his right arm. He shouts," Begin!" 
*page_break
The crowd around the coliseum, cheers loudly. You can hear it through the sound system. The Verl'ak charges Alison, who stands calmly and removes a arrow from her quiver. She aims her bow, pulls back, then releases. Her arrow shoots through the air right into the knee of the Verl'ak. His black blood spurts out of his knee. He stops running, falling on his wounded knee. Alison releases another arrow into the Verl'ak's left shoulder, he sags and drops his sword. Alison releases one more arrow into his left knee, her arrow goes right through his knee. Everyone in the bar and the coliseum shout and cheer. Alison smiles and takes out her gladius sword with her right hand, putting her bow in the quiver. 
Alison approaches the wounded and bleeding, kneeling Verl'ak, his black blood soaked armor quite a sight. Alison swings her gladius sword through the Verl'ak's strong neck with force you didn't know she had. Black blood sprays over Alison and the sands of the arena. Alison wipes her face with her left arm gauntlet. The headless. body of the Verl'ak falls over limply onto the ground. Mike and the rest of the bar cheer louder than the damn crowd. 

" Alison Ryan has got skill man. You know she hasn't lost one fight. She's undefeated just like Colt," Mike says. 

Ah yes how could you forget the Undefeated Olympian Colt. You don't know why but there is something you don't like about Colt. You should like him even though he makes your District proud. Your Dad sure does love him, he always goes on and on about how great of a warrior Colt Michaels is. 
Colt Michaels' fight is up next, you decide to...
Continue watching to see Colt with Mike and the team. You nod, silently agreeing with Mike. He talks about Colt, his life story and how at 14 years old Colt was already ready for the arena. 
Colt is a L'oik fighter, Mike says the Leader of the Enyeta loves Colt. That is one of his favorite L'oik. The Leader is quite proud of him and Alison too. She is a success like no other as well.

You shake your head, there is just some shit you won't do once a week. You only go once a month luckily. You order...
Two beers. One for me and one for Mike. You order it and the bartender goes and gives you two mugs from tap. It is the best beer in Olympic. Or so your Dad says.
