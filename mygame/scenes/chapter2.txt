You finally made it to the Olympic District, finally getting out of the crazy ${trafficType}. The Olympic District is dedicated completely to physical fitness and physical perfection. That explains the gyms on every corner. As well as the joggers running on the sidewalks checking their heart rate.  The gyms have the best, state of the art, work-out equipment with plent of protein shake vendors.
*line_break
*line_break
Fitness wear stores on every five blocks. Olympians get their clothes from there. The clothes are either sweats or spandex, in any color with the District seal on it. Letterman jackets are sold here too with high school and district seal patches on them already. If you want jeans or casual clothes go the Lixury District.
*page_break
There are nutrition bars on every corner to make sure Olympians, aka people of the Olympic District, stick with a healthy and nutritious diet. Your Olympian diet consists of plant foods, fruit, grains, starches, and a large amount of meat. You wash all that done with either a gallon of water or some sports drink. Thankfully Gatorade is still around, though an alien race known as the Nonol'a concocted a sports drink known as O3. You have yet to try it yet, but if you get to go out tonight maybe you'll get to try it.
*line_break
*line_break
The Olympic District is known for breeding winners and top notch physical specimens. It is almost certain to breed winners. Because of the rigorous day to day routine for Olympians. Olympians work out six days a week, 4 hours a day. Including running a requirement of 2 miles.
*line_break
*line_break
At age 13, every Olympian is required to pass a physical fitness test. Your dad made sure you passed it, he pushed you past the test requirements. It is known as the Olympic District Physical Fitness Test.
*page_break
An Olympian must do 110 push-ups within 2 minutes. Another part of the test is 200 chin-ups in 2 minutes. 250 sit-ups in 2:30 minutes. Last is 2 miles in 10 minutes. Once you pass the test, the Olympian is rewarded with a tattoo of the Olympic District seal on your arm. You remember the day you got your's. It hurt like a bitch for a thirteen year old kid.
*line_break
*line_break
Your dad had you do 150 push-ups within 1 minute. 200 chin-ups in 1:30. 150 sit-ups in 1 minute. 2 miles in 5 minutes. You remember the back-breaking training your dad put you through when you were only 13.
*line_break
*line_break
Your District has a motto in latin," Surgram." It means, " I shall rise." Olympians take that meaning you will rise until there is no one else to stand against you. Others interpret it as rising to perfection.
*line_break
*line_break
The Olympic District motto is on the seal as well, in latin. The seal is a brown horned ox with smoke coming from its nose. The latin phrase underneath it. The ox is on a red background with axes crossed behind it.
*page_break
You park your ${vehicle} in your driveway, behind Cassie's light blue Volkswagen and your dad's hovercar. Now a hovercar is expensive but your dad has the means to get it. Your dad is legendary fighter and sports legend Gordon ${last_name}. Your dad was perhaps one of the strongest and fastest Olympian too bad he never was offered to be a L'oik or a Larken. Which was odd, anyway he never let that go. That explains him pushing you to be the best of the best.
*line_break
*line_break
Your house looks like an ordinary middle-class home. It has a cozy look to it, it should since its only you, your sister Cassie, and your dad. You use your key to open the front door. The sound of AHT, Alien and Human Television coming from the living room. You walk into the living room, your dad is sitting in his favorite recliner chair watching AHT on his huge plasma tv. Your dad has ${hair_color} hair with ${eye_color} eyes. His has ${skin} skin. He is bulging with muscle, his height is about 6'6.
*page_break
"Finally home?" Dad asked.

"Good thing you're here now we can watch the L'oik and Larken  gladiator matches."
*line_break
*line_break
L'oik? You almost forgot. L'oik and Larken are children of the districts from ages 15-25 who are chosen from in The Choosing.
*line_break
*line_break
The Choosing is where the Enyeta pick one boy and one girl from each District and then take them away to be experimented on. The Enyeta who made the L'oik has asked for this so he can make more of his L'oik. He has over twenty successful ones but most of the subjects don't live through the experience. It is dangerous for humans. The same thing for the Enyeta who created the Larken. You think about your ride to here earlier.
*line_break
*line_break
On the way from the school when you stopped to look at an advertisement. It has the photo of the human girl gladiator Alison on it.
*page_break
For entertainment and intimidation, the Enyeta do some kind of experiments on humans and other species and then make them compete in gladiatorial events. It is basically human boys and girls slaughtering their own kind and aliens. Or aliens slaughtering both humans and other aliens.
*line_break
*line_break
There are nine different alien species. Each species with their own social hierarchy along with the social hierarchy on Earth. 
There is (in hierarchal order) the Enyeta, Threi, Venusians, Aracesians, Martians, Verl'aks, Sh'iik, G'lan, and the Lupek. Humans are at the bottom and thought of as slaves. The only humans that matter are the genetically enchanced humans known as the L'oik and the Larken.
*line_break
*line_break
Alison is a L'oik and from what you hear and see she is the best female fighter. Gladiator fights are televised all over for the world to see. It is a way to show humans not to rebel. 
*line_break
*line_break
The best L'oik and Larken come from the Olympic District. The true purpose of the Olympic District is to get humans ready to be chosen and physically prepared for the process of being a L'oik or a Larken.
*page_break
Once you become a L'oik or Larken, you are first showcased to the world. A interview is held by some fancy guy and the new L'oik or Larken. You are interviewed and asked a few simple questions about yourself so the people can decide if they like you. If you have a positive interview and the people like you, you are then forced to fight in the arena.
*line_break
*line_break
The goal is to win in the arena and garner more favor from the people of the world. If you lose it may be alright but only if the people demand your life be spared. If not then you die. If you win and continuously win, you are a celebrity. The people will love you and you will become rich and be on AHT. And in movies and all sorts of lucrative opportunities. Which is why people in the Lawless District believe becoming a Larken or a L'oik is one of the greatest things that can ever happen to an Olympian.
*line_break
*line_break
What do you think?
*choice
  #I don't like it.
    You don't think so because what people don't know is...every time you step out into that arena you are forfeiting your life and everything you own. Even if you become rich and famous, you are still a slave to the Enyeta only your chains are invisible.
    *goto dad_asks
  #Being a L'oik or Larken would be great.
    You wouldn't have to worry about money and you would get the chance to become famous. It is like a dream come true.

How do you react?

  #I don't. Cassie is my sister she knows I don't care. 
    Cassie is your best friend. The two of you are really close. You tell each other everything. There are no secrets between you. You love your sister. You play with the bracelet Cassie made you. 
    *line_break
    *line_break
    You remember the first time she gave it to you. You were thirteen and she was twelve. Cassie loved art back then so in art class they were making jewelry for someone they loved the most. You couldn't believe it when Cassie brought it home and gave it to you. Cassie made you promise to never take it off. You promised that you wouldn't and haven't ever taken it off. And after that the two of have been closer than any other brother and sister. Thats why she is the only good thing in your life.

  #I berate Cassie.
    She shouldn't have just came in without me saying it was okay. She just rolls her eyes at you as you play with the bracelet she gave you. You remember the first time she gave it to you. You were thirteen and she was twelve. Cassie loved art back then so in art class they were making jewelry for someone they loved the most. You couldn't believe it when Cassie brought it home and gave it to you because you and Cassie are always yelling at each other. Cassie made you promise to never take it off.
